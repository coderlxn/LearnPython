# A collection of variable and function definitions in a file is called a Python module. A collection of related
# modules is called a package. NLTK's code for processing the Brown Corpus is an example of a module,
# and its collection of code for processing all the different corpora is an example of a package. NLTK itself is a
# set of packages, sometimes called a library.
